##Fork of [Aeon Nox](https://github.com/BigNoid/Aeon-Nox) for XBMC
###by Erik S

Slightly modified Aeon Nox to match my personal preferences.

My modifications are:
* New view called [Simple List](https://raw.github.com/eriksoderblom/Aeon-Nox/master/_screenshots/screenshot009.jpg)
* Darker bars on home screen (time, library stats and submenu)
* Video browser uses the background from Video menu option on home screen (if one is set)
* Scrollbar on left instead of right on List view
* Removed floor on List view
* Unwatched episodes instead of year on low list, moved year label
* Show season number on selected episode on episode view
